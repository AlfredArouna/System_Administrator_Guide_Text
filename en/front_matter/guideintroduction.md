####Background####
Over the years, we have seen various examples of how the internet can [empower civil society vis-Ã -vis public officials](http://www.ipaidabribe.com/), make the [government more accountable to its citizens](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/socialdevelopment/publication/budget-transparency-initiative), and integrate [citizens into the policymaking process](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/). The internet has also been used for [organizing mass movements](http://mic.com/articles/10642/twitter-revolution-how-the-arab-spring-was-helped-by-social-media), while at the same time, being used to squash citizen dissent by governments [investing in surveillance technologies](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/foreigners/2015/06/mass_surveillance_violates_international_law_david_kaye_s_report_to_the.html) to spy on netizens.

Based on the [Freedom of Net 2014 report](https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-net/freedom-net-2014) there has been increased government pressure on independent news websites, which had previously been among the few uninhibited sources of information in many countries, in addition to more people detained or prosecuted for their digital activities than ever before.

The FOTN report also highlights that internet freedom around the world has declined for the fourth consecutive year, with a growing number of countries introducing online censorship and monitoring practices that are simultaneously more aggressive and more sophisticated in their targeting of individual users. 

The internet has become a new battleground between governments that censor online content and those who advocate freedom to browse, post, and share information online for all, regardless of their place of residence.

####Role of a System Administrator####
Within their area of responsibility, system administrators facilitate end-user privilege management, implement operating procedures to conform to information security standards, and the adoption of security protocols. [^adminrole] However, the role of a System Administrator working in an at-risk organization goes beyond the daily grind of monitoring networks, user-account management or setting up firewall rules. 

Given the changing technology environment, system administrators have the additional responsibility to be **change agents** within their organization and steer decision-makers and staff to adopt a more holistic approach to security after understanding the context within which their organization is operating, the risks it faces and the laws that govern it.
