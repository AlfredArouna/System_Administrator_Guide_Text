##Service Level Agreement: Do's and Dont's## {#chapter5}

As you go about your daily tasks working at a human rights-focused organization or media outlet, you need to pay special attention to agreements negotiated with service providers such as your ISP (internet service provider), hardware vendor (especially as it relates to server hardware), and when hosting a website externally, your hosting provider.

A Service Level Agreement (SLA, for short) is a legal document that explains what your organization gets when it pays another organization or company. A SLA should include a specified level of service, support options, enforcement or penalty provisions for services not provided, a guaranteed level of system performance as relates to downtime or uptime, a specified level of customer support, communication protocol (including contact information for emergency assistance), privacy policy (to safeguard your data), software or hardware that will be provided and associated costs.

Your SLA plays an important role in defining the relationship between you and your IT service provider. It enables transparency and committment by the provider that guarantees you a certain level of service, giving you confidence that if something goes wrong, the service provider will respond quickly. Without a comprehensive SLA in place, you are unlikely to have much leverage if your IT service provider fails to respond to your requests.

###Best Practices###

Here are a few suggested best practices as recommended in ITDonut's sample service level agreement [^agreement_components]:

#### 5.1 Uptime ####

This applies to important equipment, software or services that your business needs. Typically, uptime guarantees apply to servers, cloud services (like email or web hosting) or your internet (ISP) & office telephone service and other parts of your IT system that are vital to your business. For example, your service provider might guarantee 99.9% uptime for your internet connection. The agreement should also detail the compensation available when the provider fails to meet their end of the agreement (see 5.3 SLA Penalties) and clarify whether uptime results are included in weekly and monthly reports.

#### 5.2 Response Times ####

These measure how long it takes your service provider to respond when you raise a request for support. Usually, support requests have to be raised in a specific way, often through an online reporting system. As an example, your service provider might promise to respond to critical problems within 15 minutes once a service request has been filed.

It is also important to know what kind of skills will be available to you for support or how quickly the provider can effectively solve any issues (refer to resoultion times in the section below). As part of your emergency response plan, you might want to clarify in the SLA alternative methods for reaching the ISP when service to the office network is completely down and where applicable, discuss secure means of communication. 



#### 5.3 SLA Penalties ####

Your SLA should detail what compensation you will receive if the service provider fails to meet its promises. But keep in mind that different IT service providers will offer different levels of compensation with different payment thresholds. Usually, compensation takes the form of an account credit, reducing the cost of your IT support for the following month. For example, you might receive a 5% credit for every hour the provider fails to meet a target.

A good service level agreement should also provide a get-out clause, so you can terminate the contract if the provider repeatedly fails to meet the SLA. This example service level agreement shows a few typical penalty clauses, and some common exclusions. As with any contract, the devil is in the details.

#### 5.4 Resolution Time versus Response Time ####

While response time indicates how quickly a service provider will respond to your request based on its priority (severe/emergency, urgent, medium or low), most providers will not guarantee resolution times. This is because the most severe, disruptive problems (like hardware failures) can take a long time to get resolved. For example, a server crash can sometimes be resolved by simply restarting the server, which might take a few minutes. But a server may also go offline because of a hard disk failure. If this happens, it can take a day or two to receive the replacement disk, reinstall software and restore data from backups. Yet both these problems might be classed as 'severe', falling under the same resolution time.

#### 5.5 Exclusions ####

As mentioned above, sometimes it may be impossible to fix a problem within an hour or two as your service provider may have to order a part or physically visit your office. It’s common for an SLA to exclude circumstances like these. 

Keep "end-of-life" [(example)](https://www.google.com/chrome/devices/eol.html) considerations in mind when choosing services or products. 

#### 5.6 Compensation Cap ####

Most service level agreements cap account credits at a certain level. Make sure you’re happy with this. If not, consider negotiating a clause to say you can end the contract if the provider hits the cap.

#### 5.7 Support Availability ####

Many SLA support conditions only apply during the normal work day. You may have to pay more for 24/7 coverage. Consider your organization's needs to ensure you have the level of support that is needed by your IT service providers.

#### 5.8 Your Obligations ####

You’ll need to keep up your side of the bargain for the SLA to apply, too. Be clear on what you can and can’t do. For instance, you may not be permitted to install unapproved software on company computers.

#### 5.9 Emergency Contact Information ####

Ensure the SLA has contact phone numbers of your providers clearly listed and especially any 24/7 guaranteed response number for emergency situations. On your end, it may be prudent to create an internal communication plan to ensure key stakeholders within your organization (including staff on the road) are aware of downtime and have a way to reach you during an emergency. And as mentioned above, as part of your emergency response plan, you might want to clarify in the SLA any alternative methods for reaching the ISP when service to the office network is completely down and where applicable, discuss secure means of communication.

#### 5.10 Data Retention and Access Policies Vis-à-Vis Restrictions Based on Local Laws ####

Working at a human rights organization or media outlet, you should pay special attention to the data retention, privacy and access policies of your service provider, with special emphasis on their obligation to provide local law enforcement access to your data or systems without your permission.

The SLA should include how your data is protected, what privacy policy is applied to the services and how a provider (example: web host) will react in case your site is under any form of cyberattack. In addition, ensure you are fully aware of their content disposal policies, as well- this is especially important if the ISP hosts your organization’s email service 



Finally, remember that while an SLA gives you some backup and confidence, it’s no substitute for having a good relationship with an IT service provider you trust.
