**Introduction**

We assess and manage risks constantly in our daily activities - from pouring a hot cup of coffee in a paper cup to crossing a busy road during rush-hour traffic. This innate habit of assessing risks transcends to business as well, such as planning against financial uncertainty by diversifying revenue streams or reacting to new laws that could affect organizational impact. While managing physical and financial risks is important, it is imperative to apply these concepts to information and communication security, and the overall *digital well-being* of an organization, as well. 

As a system administrator working at an organization focused on human rights or in a media outlet, you are uniquely positioned to influence digital well-being and have a responsibility beyond the daily tasks of monitoring network traffic and user account management to lead your organization through a holistic approach to security. After all, digital security is not just about the tools used but an understanding of risks and measures that need to be taken to mitigate them - more often, these measures may include enhancing physical security, or “soft approaches” such as raising end-user awareness & training, instead of further investment in a top-of-the-line IDPS (intrusion detection & prevention system). While the latter is essential, the vulnerabilities exposed by an insecure work environment (device theft) or an ill-informed end-user whose email account gets hacked due to weak password practices (information & identity theft) can expose sensitive organizational data, causing havoc and should not be ignored. As such, a 360-degree approach to digital security –which goes beyond systems and software is essential. 

Having said this, digital security is also *not* just the sole responsibility of a system administrator or IT staff - it requires an organizational commitment from staff at every level, from decision-makers to the receptionist, with a unified pledge of safeguarding the organization’s mission, its progress, reputation and the physical well-being of all associated individuals (staff, target audience of work performed, partner, donors, etc.) Organizational buy-in is critical for a security plan to succeed - as holistic security encompasses technology, processes and people. 

As such, an essential first step towards a 360-degree holistic approach to digital security is to understand the various risks targeting your organization by conducting a Risk Assessment in collaboration with key stakeholders -- these include decision-makers and staff representatives at various levels, from every business unit.  

Conducting a Risk Assessment will help you analyze **risks** to your organization, paint a complete picture of possible **threats**, will help identify **adversaries**, pinpoint **vulnerabilities** and more importantly, access the organization’s **capacities** that can help mitigate these risks. 

The assessment is a simple 4-step process laid out below, but first we look at a few basic definitions. 

**Understanding the various elements**

An overview of terms follows:

- *Risk* - the possibility of events that result in harm (For example: censorship of websites focusing on human rights or articles published by independent media)
- *Threat* – declaration or indication of an intention to inflict damage, punish or hurt, whether recent or immediate. (For example: investment in surveillance technology by government)
- *Capacity*– any resource, including abilities and contacts, which improves security (For example: executives include IT security in organizational budgets; staff follow IT best practices with respect to password management, 2-factor authentication,data backup and secure communication) 
- *Vulnerability* – any factor which makes it more likely for harm to materialize or result in greater damage (For example: staff not trained on use of secure technologies) 
- *Adversary* - a person or entity looking to benefit via exploitation of a risk (For example: state actors or competitors)

As such, Risk can be understood via a basic formula:

The Risk Formula helps to focus on separate elements. In order to reduce risk, one of three things must happen:
- Threats are reduced
- Vulnerabilities are reduced 
- Capacities are increased

While in most cases, it may be difficult to reduce threats; an organization can mitigate them by reducing their vulnerabilities and increasing their capacities. Throughout this guide, you will find various best practices to help you reduce vulnerabilities and improve your organization’s capacities with the end goal of mitigating digital risks.

**Step 1 - Identify Risks, Vulnerabilities & Capacities**

Having understood the definitions of the various elements and their relationship with each other, the next step in the Risk Assessment process is to verbally map, as a group, the various risks your organization faces, consider your vulnerabilities for each, list existing abilities and resources you possess and identify required capacities that you can reasonably acquire. Here is a [simple worksheet](https://www.frontlinedefenders.org/files/workbook_eng.pdf) (Figure 2.1 page 15; Frontline Defenders: Workbook on Security) that can help facilitate this process. 
As you go through this step, answering the following questions, in collaboration with key stakeholders, will help kick-start the conversation: 
- What do you want to protect? Write down a list of data that you maintain, where it’s kept, who has access to it, and what stops others from accessing it. This question will help you identify existing vulnerabilities and capacities. 
- Who do you want to protect it from? Make a list of who might want to get a hold of your data or communications. It might be an individual, a government agency, or a corporation. This question will help you identify your adversaries. 
- Write down what your adversary might want to do with your private data. This question will help you identify risks associated given the existing vulnerabilities. 

Completing the worksheet with the information gathered through this “discovery” process will provide a detailed list of the challenges at hand. 

Since risks will differ according to the unique context of your country, the patterns of threats and attacks, the perpetrators, the degree of impunity, and the individual’s identity, profile, activities and location, this step takes into account the context (political, socio-economic) within which your organization operates and creates a framework to work within as you design an operational security plan for your organization. It also takes into account the ever-changing realities (scenarios) and builds in flexibility to accommodate these unique scenarios. 

**Step 2- Risk Matrix**

Based on your specific scenario, the list of potential risks can be overwhelming and can create a sense of “panic” among staff who may feel paralyzed by existing vulnerabilities that need to be addressed, especially if capacities are hugely lacking. 

As such, as a next step, it’s imperative to assess the probability and impact of these risks. Mapping these risks against a Risk Matrix will help you prioritize the areas where most attention is required, without overwhelming staff, business processes and limited resources. 

**ADD IMAGE**

Map each risk based on its impact (what are the consequences if this risk is not addressed) with its likelihood occurring (what is the probability that this risk will occur). 

If the probability of the risk occurring is low, and the impact is low, or the probability is very low & impact are very low (these are the lightest grey cells in the table above), you may consider these as acceptable risks, and use your normal security measures. However, for the risks that are probable, but medium to high impact (the pink/red cells), produce action plans to reduce the probability. For risks that are high to very high impact (the darkest grey cells), produce action plans and also, a contingency plan for each risk to address what to do in case this terrible event does in fact occur in order to reduce the impact.

Via this exercise, by focusing on the areas of “very high impact- very high likelihood” followed by “high impact-high likelihood” and “medium impact-medium likelihood”, you have now arrived at a set of security goals (For example: mitigate loss of sensitive data or install licensed software to prevent violations against local laws) via a prioritization process. At this stage, its also critical to also assess your organization’s capacity such as appropriate personnel, necessary time and funds that will be required. Assessing capacity will help you arrive at **practical, realistic security goals**. For example, an intrusion detection system and state-of-the-art firewall might mitigate network intrusions, but if the backup system and financial computers are what you're worried about, other mitigations could achieve much of the same outcome for less budget, less time and staff training. 

Next, breakdown these security goals into achievable tasks (For example: creation of role-based access policies, or outreach to TechSoup for discounted software) that can be executed, their progress can be monitored, responsibility assigned and costs are associated for accomplishing the security goal. (Refer to Chapter 3 on preparing an IT budget). 

**Step 3- Maintaining a risk-averse posture**

Conducting a risk assessment is not a one-time activity. As the context within which your organization operates changes (for example: introduction of stricter laws regulating NGOs; expansion of work activities in more hostile environments; enhanced investment in surveillance technologies by local authorities; change in the political environment), the risk matrix changes too. It's important to re-assess digital risks and evaluate their impact and likelihood and accordingly, maneuver the organization’s posture against the new threats. As such, it's recommended to conduct risk assessments on an on-going basis. Discuss and decide on a workable schedule to conduct regular risk assessments with the key stakeholders.

**Step 4- Empowering individuals**

Be sure to share the above risk assessment framework (Steps 1- 4) with staff as part of their IT on-boarding process or during tech awareness workshops. Each individual armed with this framework will be empowered to assess threats, identify adversaries & individual capacities and create individual security (action) plans based on their unique scenario.
