##Budgeting for Security## {#chapter4}

Even with high-profile cyber attacks on big corporations like Target and Sony, and [human-rights focused NGOs](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2846086/rights-groups-ngos-struggle-against-malware-attacks.html), cyber security makes up a [relatively small portion](http://www.govtech.com/security/Report-Rising-Cybersecurity-Budgets-Still-Not-Enough.html) of many organizations’ overall IT budgets.

As you create plans to safeguard your organization’s assets against cyber threats, it’s important to help managers and decision-makers in the organization understand the need for the necessary investments in cyber security for business contiunity, whether this means purchase of anti-virus software and non-pirated software licenses, a secure website hosting service, locks for the physical protection of the server room or printing digital best practices material for distribution to staff.

Decision-makers need to understand the seriousness of cyber threats—their risks and potential impact on the organization’s data, communications and digital assets, including physical security of the office and more importantly, their staff and sources, thus hampering mission (business) continutity.

Here are some best practices to help you make a business case to decision-makers in your organization for better investment in a cyber security program:

###Best Practices###

#### 4.1 Make a Case for Including Security as a Line Item in the Overall Organization’s Budget ####

Conducting a Risk Assessment (Refer to Chapter 1) will help you understand the threats to your organization, identify the various adversaries, the likelihood and impact of the various threats. Your strategies to mitigate these threats will help define the types of new or updated security controls -- whether processes, technologies, or educational programs -- that will be required by your organization.
Involving decision makers and stakeholders, at all levels, in the Risk Assessment process will ensure you not only get a holistic sense of threats, adversaries and potential impact to the organization but also have indirectly received their buy-in via their participation, as they will start to understand the impact of a potential cyber-incident.

Taking this a step further, help decision-makers understand the business and reputational cost (in monetary terms) to the organization if security initiatives identified to tackle the “high likelihood, high impact” threats are not undertaken. For example: the loss in annual donations collected via your organization’s website if the website gets hacked and personal identifiable information (PII) of donors is leaked.
This will help you illustrate the financial benefits (create a business case) for investment in security initiatives and will ensure you receive the necessary financial support to implement a security plan for the organization.

Furthermore, by getting buy-in from decision makers, you are involving the stakeholders in the design process of the security program, which will allow for easier adoption of security protocols and user policies.

#### 4.2 IT Budget - Do’s and Don’ts ####

With threats to your organization’s assets - both digital and physical (including those to staff, partners or sources) and strategies to mitigate them identified, the next step is to ensure you have a plan in place to tackle them by making the right investments. The first step in creating a plan that matches your organization’s risk assessment priorities is to create a corresponding IT budget.

Building a budget involves three core components: People, Process, and Technology. Focusing on the threats that have the highest likelihood of occurring and will cause the highest impact, break down the various security initiatives across these 3 components. For each initiative, list the people required (or skills required), the process changes that are essential and the accompanying technology investments that would be necessary.

While defining your requirements, consider how each of these items reduces organizational risk, any alternatives (such as open source software) that may exist at a lower cost, and the security risk of not including it.

With the identification of requirements and their categorization in place, map these needs to a budget framework with estimated costs for each initiative. Don't forget to include the costs of implementation, and post-installation support when arriving at an estimated cost for each item.
While getting buy-in for your recommended IT budget help decision-makers understand their options and remind them of potential impacts. Are they willing to accept the risks of business disruption or privacy breaches that can stem from cyber incidents, or are they willing to authorize funding for organization-wide digital security initiatives to mitigate those risks?

#### 4.3 Security Program Metrics ####

With the appropriate security measures in place, it's important to help decision-makers gauge the effectiveness of a cyber security program in your organization by putting the necessary metrics in place. After all, building trust with decision-makers who are the ultimate budget authority will increase your effectiveness to get the necessary approvals for future investments in security protocols.

Ensure that you are measuring how the current security measures are safeguarding the organization’s data, communication and its people. Some of these metrics may include:

- System and services uptime (such as a website, email or other services)
- Reduction of spam
- Use of licensed software
- Ability of staff to better respond to viruses, malware and social engineering attacks, leading to reduction in cyber incidents
- Staff using password-management software and two-factor authentication on all their accounts - work and personal
- Reduction of response time for incidents (the ability to re-image a laptop after a virus versus re-installing from scratch)
- Staff adhering to IT policies and best practices regarding BYOD (Bring Your Own Device, such as a phone or tablet, to the office), mobile security, data backup and secure communication.
- Measures in place to ensure authorized access to sensitive data and systems
- Measures in place to safeguard physical access to the organization’s assets
- Measures in pace to protect the online reputation of the organization via Facebook, Twitter, YouTube.
- Number of digital security awareness sessions conducted with staff

#### 4.4 Communication with Decision-Makers ####

Regular communication regarding the organization’s risk posture and the effectiveness of its cyber security program will convince decision-makers with regards to the need for the recommended user policies (for example: password management, BYOD policy or secure communications) and changes in business workflows (for example: while working in a media agency, even with tight deadlines to release a news story, first downloading material received from a source on a USB to a computer which can run a scan to check for viruses, before using it on their personal laptops).

Sending monthly updates to your managers illustrating the value and effectiveness of the security measures, in alignment with the organization’s Key Performance Indicators (KPIs, such as funding goals, partnership goals, reduction of threats from adversaries) will raise visibility of the measures implemented, while also ensuring the much-needed support for future enhancements or changes later. Based on your organization’s risk assessment, some metrics that may be useful to track include:

- The number of accounts hijacked before and after new password requirements are implemented.
- The number of viruses spotted on the office network before and after changes to BYOD policies.
- The click-rate of staff members who receive phishing emails before and after awareness training.
- The number of viruses that reach staff laptops before and after implementing a policy to sandbox-and-scan USB flash memory sticks.
- Adoption rates of encrypted email among staff members.

In addition, sharing news and information about security trends will ensure that both, management and staff, are kept well-informed about emerging threats that may impact the security of their data or communications. (Refer to Chapter 3 for suggested best practices related to Staff Awareness & Communications)

#### 4.5 Peer Knowledge Exchange ####

As you design a security program for your organization, it is a good practice to also share and learn from other organizations experiencing similar risks. Creating a safe “peer” space for system administrators working at community organizations, whether at a media outlets and/or human rights organization, to come together and share their knowledge will help you learn about potential threats, steps taken to mitigate them and will serve as an early-warning system for identification of potential threats, allowing you to be proactive in planning against them.
