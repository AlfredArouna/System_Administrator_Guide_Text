## Know Your Rights: In-Country Rules & Regulations ## {#chapter11}

As you institute measures for information and communication security for your organization, it’s important to be aware of local, national and international laws that apply to your organization based on the nature of its work as well as any IT and privacy regulations that could impact your organization’s policies and business workflows.

For example, laws in various countries around the globe (for example: [Cuba](http://translatingcuba.com/from-lemon-juice-to-encrypted-code-yoani-sanchez/)) make use of encryption software illegal. And, in fact, the U.S. State Department advises persons traveling to Russia that taking laptops into that nation is unrestricted, but software may be inspected upon leaving. Any computer or software [containing sensitive or encrypted data](http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/archive/2013/August/pages/UseCautionWhenTravelingWithEncryptionSoftware.aspx?PF=1) may be confiscated by Russian authorities.

Moreover, restrictive regimes have known to [use anti-piracy laws against independent media](http://ipjournal.law.wfu.edu/2011/02/microsoft-allows-unilateral-software-licenses-to-russian-ngos-and-media-organizations/) or [NGOs focused on human rights](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2010/09/13/anti-piracy-enforcement-and-ngos/). And governments are quickly moving towards [implementing “data localization” policies](http://www.acslaw.org/sites/default/files/ChanderAnupamBreakingtheWebDataLocalizationvstheGlobalInternet.pdf) to restrict movement of information across borders – threatening the very fabric of the global internet.

Furthermore, there are various laws in place to safeguard personal identifyable information collected by employers. For example, under USA-Maryland state’s law, if an organization destroys records that contain a user’s personal information, the organization is required to take reasonable steps to prevent unauthorized access to, or use of, the personal information, taking into consideration factors that include the sensitivity of the records, costs, and available technology.

In addition, under other US state laws, including California, Massachusetts, and Maryland, if your organization uses a nonaffiliated third party to perform services (for example: cloud-based donor management database or employee records management database) and if you disclose personal information about a resident of that state under a written contract, then your organization must by contract require the third party to implement and maintain its own reasonable and appropriate security procedures and practices to help protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, modification, disclosure or destruction.  Since many nonprofit organizations strive for a national or international membership base, and most also outsource important functions that provide third party service providers with access to personal information via cloud computing services, these nonprofit organizations are subject to those requirements.

As such, it’s imperative to understand the legal IT aspects of operating within your local context. Here are a few suggestions [^rights_suggestions] to keep in mind:

**Learn**: Know the laws that apply to you and what they require you to do. While the resources listed under the “Recommended Reading” section can aid you with initial research, they are not intended to be comprehensive  – rather, an essential step is to consult with a local lawyer to understand the true impact of local, national and international laws while designing an effective information and communication security system for your organization.

**Audit**: Audit your security practices and map out how you collect, share, store and use personal identifiable information (PII) of staff, donors, partners or visitors to your website.

**Implement**: Design and implement a privacy and security plan that complies with applicable laws, limits exposure, and increases stakeholder confidence. Refer to Chapters 7 (Network Security), 8 (Data Security, Backup & Recovery), 9 (Website, Software & System Security) and 10 (Physical Security) for best practices.

**Comply and Adjust**: Follow the plan, stay current on the legal requirements, and update your protections as technologies and laws change.

**Mitigate**: Prepare a risk mitigation plan, including how to handle the bad publicity, and swiftly implement it if the worst, such as a data breach, occurs.
In view of the complex patchwork of data security and privacy laws, taking preventive measures to minimize the likelihood or scope of run-ins with the law by establishing appropriate tech policies and contingency plans will ensure legal compliance and will result in a positive outcome for all stakeholders, your organization and its mission.
