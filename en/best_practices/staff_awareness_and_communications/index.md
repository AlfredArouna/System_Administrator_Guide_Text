##Staff Awareness & Training##

While a holistic approach to security encompasses technology, process and people - the main focus of this chapter is on *“the people”*- this is the area of greatest impact. One can have the best technology and practices in place, however, if they are not used or followed appropriately, then other efforts will fall short of safeguarding an organization against security threats. 

In most small-to-mid sized organizations, the system administrator is the first level contact for end-users for computer & network support. In addition to monitoring the network & data security, System Administrators should assume the responsibility of educating their end-users on security best practices. After all, end-users are the ultimate consumers of the data traveling on the network and are at the frontlines of targeted attacks to their information and communication.

Network security wouldn’t succeed without partnership with your end-users.  Its imperative to gain their trust to achieve holistic security. 

Below are some of the suggested best practices and approaches related to communicating policies to staff, raising security awareness and providing skills training. 

####Best Practices####

**3.1 Usage Policies**

Having conducted a Risk Assessment (Refer to Chapter 1) to understand threats to your organization’s infrastructure, set clear usage policies that define use of the organization’s IT resources (computers, printers, scanners, internet/bandwidth) for work-related purposes. 

Understand the various profile of users in your organization (from program staff, to accountants, to editors or executive management), create data workflows for each profile to understand their unique business processes and apply a “User Centered Design” approach while creating policies. Policies created without the end-user in mind will lead to frustrated users finding “shortcuts” to circumvent security measures, leading to increased potential security holes that go unnoticed. 

Get end-user buy in while setting these policies to ensure that the solution will be successful and will not fail due to passive resistance, as ultimately “it’s about the users”- they need to understand the reasons as to why strict adherence to these policies will safe-guard them against malicious attacks and secure their data & communication. Refer to Chapter 2 on recommended tech policies. 

**3.2 Identifying ‘privileged’ users**

Your organization’s Risk Assessment (Refer to Chapter 1) will identify users within the organization who need access to sensitive data. This will help you short-list the ‘privileged’ users in your organizations. They could include your organization’s executives, accounting staff, human resources staff, individuals working on high-stake projects such as business plans, financial forecasts, project strategies, donor & partner relationships or in a media organization, this could include the new reporters & editors. Their common trait, from an organizational security perspective, is that they all have more access to sensitive organizational data, making them easier targets for cyber threats as compared to other non-privileged users. 

Since each user’s workflow & style differs, its imperative to create an individual security plan for them. (Refer to Chapter 7 for best practices related to the *“principle of least privilege”*) These plans should receive their buy-in and address specific data access, storage, sharing and communication tools and protocols. Also, since scenarios keep changing, the security plan should address a methodology that they can adhere to while accessing risk and its impact. (Refer to Chapter 1 for the Risk Assessment plan). 

**3.3 Managing the Change**

Nothing assures faster failure than a new set of rules (change) implemented without proper planning or end-user buy-in. When implementing a new security policy (such as BYOD policy or use of encrypted emails for all communication), ensure you have a solid change management process defined to get end-user buy-in and adoption of this new security policy. The process should allow end-users to learn about the changes, understand why they are necessary, in addition to soliciting their support to ensure change is adopted seamlessly. 

One process model that is often cited is ADKAR: Awareness-Desire-Knowledge-Ability-Reinforcement and we’ll take a few moments to examine it. 

**ADD IMAGE**

This model focuses on outcomes and not on tasks to be performed. Many change models describe what needs to be done, while this model describes the outcomes. 

The focus of this model is on individual change, ensuring each person makes the transition. When you focus on the individual, you are able to measure where they are in the change process and what is required to assist them. You are not simply relying on running a certain number of training programs, or communicating a particular message, and expecting everyone to follow.

Following are some best practices when instituting organizational wide change to tech processes. We’ll look at concrete examples of these principles in our next section (3.4): 
- **Provide early and consistent communication**: Your employees will resist change more when it is sudden and they have little time to adjust. Release information as soon as possible, and then roll out the change in incremental steps.
- **Iron out the kinks**: Nothing is more frustrating than a new software system that is buggy, or a new set of rules that never stay the same. Make sure the change is tested and is rock-solid before you start implementing it. Create a roll-back plan to revert to incase the change fails.  
- **Time it right**: Try not to roll out change during a time of the year that is busy, or when the organization is under exceptional pressure.
- **Make the change desirable, get end-user buy-in**: Help end-users understand the need for the change by discussing problems with the current system, and soliciting advice in making the change successful. Ensure you have their buy-in to ensure seamless adoption. Compile this feedback with statistics and trend data. Design a presentation that promotes the change.
- **Make the benefits relevant**: Help end-users understand the big picture by outlining the organization’s threats, and illustrating how the change will help mitigate them. Break down the benefits so they apply directly to them. For example, how using a password management system will protect organizational data or how using encrypted channels (where permissible) would protect their communication. 
- **Monitor the change as it's implemented**: If your plan hits a snag, identify and correct it quickly, before it sours the atmosphere. Watch modified operations carefully, and instruct end-users to provide feedback. 
- **Fully integrate the change**: Help existing employees adapt to the change faster, and make sure new employees understand it right away by revising new-hire orientation material. 
- **Ease up the pressure**: Don’t expect end-users to adjust to the change right off the bat. Make it clear that there is a learning curve, and that you are open to questions and concerns. Remember that being adaptable by considering feedback may help you perfect the change. 

**3.4 Communication & Training**

Chalking up tech policies, usage protocols and security plans is not sufficient unless they are communicated well to end-users and adoption is enforced through user-friendly approaches.

**3.4.i Communication**

Advertise best practices in common rooms/hallways. Send email reminders about IT policies at the very least once a month, along with news about threats & security trends affecting human rights organizations or independent media outlets. “Humanize” cyber threats by helping users understand what these threats mean for them, the organization and their data, communication and their relationship with sources, partners or donors. 

**3.4.ii Staff-Awareness Workshops**

Your end-users are busy making the world a better place - their time is of value and most of them may be on the road, either running an advocacy campaign or meeting sources in order to cover the next breaking news story. As such, their time in the office is limited; find innovative ways to educate users on IT policies and best practices by holding short training workshops on a set date, every month, on a topic that is of value to them. You may also choose to record these training workshops to archive lessons shared via email or the organization’s intranet.

Use every opportunity to share a best practice with them - the most opportune time may be when you are helping them fixing a print error they are experiencing or installing software on their computer. A friendly conversation can be a teaching moment that will help you accomplish your goal of ensuring they are following best practices and eliminating their likelihood of being the weakest link in the security chain.

**3.4.iii Create Tech Champions within the organization**

While you have your super-hero cape on to help safeguard your organization’s information, the reality is that you are just one person with a lot of responsibilities. As you build trust relationships with end-users in the organization, identify the “super-users” and leverage their expertise as “advocates for change” who can help with adoption of IT policies on your behalf. This creates a social element of learning through peers (at the grassroots level) as opposed to the top-bottom approach of system administration. 

**3.4.iv Ease of Accessibility** 

Do your customers know how to reach you? Share your contact information with end-users, when they join the organization to make sure they have multiple ways to contact you when they need your assistance. While most system administrators spend their time behind huge screens monitoring the network, walk around and find ways to talk to end-users in hallways or in common areas - “de-mystify your presence” to ensure direct communication with your end-users.
