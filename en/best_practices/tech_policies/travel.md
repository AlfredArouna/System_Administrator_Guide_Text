The mitigation strategy for travel-related risks will depend on your organization’s unique scenario and associated threats identified (via a Risk Assessment- refer to Chapter 1). Consider your organization’s resources (budget) and capacity while implementing the following suggested best practices that are appropriate for your organization:

- Given your organization’s budget (Refer to Chapter 4- Budgeting for Security to make the business case), consider offering a loaner device to your staff instead of their main device (laptop and phone).

#### Pre-travel check-list ####

- Create a security plan with staff on-travel. Among all things technology, this plan should also include a check-in policy to notify a supervisor or colleague of physical whereabouts.
- Given the risks of the specific scenario, discuss tools that will be used for communication and sharing during travel- this may include a conversation about the use of cellphones connected to the local carrier, email application to check messages and chat applications for communication. Make sure use of encryption or anonymizers is permissible based on local laws in the destination country.
- Based on the destination (including transit countries) and associated risks, walk through a “device confiscation” scenario with staff prior to their departure to plan for data backup strategies. (For example: confiscation while crossing a border by custom officers)
- If they are traveling with their devices, ensure that they backup and remove all sensitive files or contact information of individuals from their computer/phone. Ensure that emergency contact information is shared with staff.
- Back up staff data files prior to their departure on an external, encrypted device (external HDD) or to encrypted cloud storage such as SpiderOak.
- Ensure staff understand local copyright laws when downloading digital data (music, movies, software) while aboard. They should not download anything that can lead to the infringement of intellectual property and should obey copyright laws.
- Antivirus, 2-factor and updated, licensed software: The first line of defense is making sure that software on staff’s devices is up-to-date and not pirated (use licensed copies only). Every release of a software update patches a number of security vulnerabilities that have been discovered. Ensure 2-factor authentication is enabled on all their online accounts - this requires them to enter not just a password but a second code whenever they log in using an unfamiliar computer. Enable the built-in firewall on their laptops; disable Bluetooth networking to prevent unwanted connection attempts.
- Enable “remote wipe” on devices: Discuss the remote wipe feature with staff on their devices and encourage them to enable this feature to prevent data leakage in case of device loss, theft or confiscation.

#### Physical safety of equipment ####

Staff should be made aware that physical security of their devices is equally important. And they should not leave their devices out of sight; or leave their phone charging unattended in a public area or lend their phone to strangers. All devices should be locked and fully powered-down when not in use, including in the hotel room. This is to prevent “cold-boot-attacks” in case, physical access to an encrypted device is attained.

#### Considerations against local repair services ####

Based on the threat model of their unique scenario, educate staff against using a local tech repair service for their device. Based on the risks, they may be better off bringing the device back home to repair it with a certified dealer.

#### Risks of connecting to an unsecured, public wifi hotspot ####

Staff should use a VPN (such as Psiphon, RiseupVPN) to guarantee a secure, encrypted (SSL) connection while browsing the web or accessing email on unsecured, public wifi hotspots, in hotels, or at cafes or airports. They should confirm the network name and connection process with the host to ensure they are connecting to a legitimate hotspot.

#### Smart use of public computers ####

Staff should be made aware of risks associated with using a public computer, such as in an internet cafe or in the hotel business center. These computers could be loaded with damaging malware, such as key-logger programs that keep track of what one’s typing — including passwords. Limit browsing on public computers to non-essential services such as viewing a city map or museum hours and not for accessing personal services like email, social networking or banking sites, where entering your password is required. Going “incognito” - train staff on using the incognito option on web browsers in order to avoid leaving traces of their activities on public computers. Staff should be reminded to practice safe emailing habits such as not sharing their passwords or credit card information via email.

#### Use of docking stations ####

End Users should be reminded against charging their phone on computers via devices that they do not control, such as hotel or airport docking stations. Malicious software could be stored on these devices that could infect their computer or phone - staff should be reminded to use their personal computer or a direct-to-wall-socket charging port to charge your phone.

#### Post-travel check-list ####

Step-up a practice to check-in with staff upon their return from a field assignment. Based on concerns identified during travel, or the unique scenario (countries visited, people contacted), you may consider implementing the following best practices:

- Staff should be required to change passwords on all accounts accessed while in the field upon your return.
- A policy to wipe clean all devices should be encouraged so as to not infect the network with viruses. Standardizing on a laptop model and software for office use can facilitate the process of “imaging” devices, as opposed to implementing re-installations from scratch.
- If their computer gets infected with malware while on travel, they should hand over the device to the tech staff as either they may wish to perform forensics or know of a group such as [CitizenLab](https://citizenlab.org) who would be willing to investigate the threat.
