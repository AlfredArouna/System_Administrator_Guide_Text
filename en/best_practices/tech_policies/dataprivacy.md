Organizational data can range from email communication, organizational work plans, project budgets, contact information of partners, sources and other community organizations, documents & publications, employee records. Most staff & executives at organizations consider data protection and privacy an IT issue. While IT is usually best suited to handle the technologies and technical processes involved in storing and securing data, data protection and privacy is a holistic, organization-wide effort that should be everyone’s responsibility. After all, exposure (either via unauthorized access or internal leakage) to draft project work plans or strategies, budgets can cost an organization its reputation, can invite unnecessary government scrutiny to their work & staff, or can put its staff, partners, sources, other stakeholders at risk.

#### Enabling Encryption ####

Based on your organizational Risk Assessment (Refer to Chapter 1), which includes considerations to local laws (Refer to Chapter 11- Know Your Rights), you may consider encrypting all communication, devices to protect data - this includes instituting full-disk encryption on laptops and phones; training staff on secure communication technologies; teaching them about secure web browsing habits and enforcing pass phrase encryption via key management software.

#### Data loss prevention rules ####

Consider implementing a data loss prevention approach via rules-based data monitoring and tracking - this would enable an administrator to automate and enforce certain policies governing the use and movement of customer data. For example, set a rule that prevents any sensitive files (containing employee salary information or project plans) from being shared with anyone outside the organization. This would prevent either an accidental disclosure or an employee overtly sending data out to someone [outside] the organization.

This, of course, would only work if all staff use an organization-wide email system for communication, as opposed to free cloud-based email providers such as Gmail.

#### Address the BYOD issue ####

BYOD (Bring-Your-Own-Device) is a data privacy issue as employees access and  store organizational data on personal devices. Enforce the best practices identified under the BYOD policy section of this chapter to safeguard organizational data and user identities.

#### Safeguards against “shadow infrastructure” ####

Shadow infrastructure implies the use of cloud infrastructure (such as Gmail, Google Drive or Dropbox) by staff for communication and data storage. Since this infrastructure is beyond your control, following are recommended suggestions to ensure organizational data protection and  privacy:

- While using cloud-based technologies for communication and data storage, help staff understand the implications of local laws with respect to government access to their data (Refer to Chapter 11: Know your Rights)
- Staff should work with the IT department when selecting a cloud-service provider that will protect their data and  privacy even under extreme conditions of government pressure. It may be advisable to work with cloud providers to include addendums to the standard agreement that cover specific needs for protecting your organization's data and privacy. While you may not get a warm response, as vendors often do not want to enter into one-off deals, nonetheless, it's an important area to address. (Refer to Chapter 5 for a list of vendors recommended by the Internet Freedom community).
- Ensure that the cloud-service provider ensures end-to-end encryption, no ability for their system administrators to access your data (complete user privacy) and the option to enable 2-factor authentication.
- Enforce a strict policy for staff of not storing confidential, sensitive information or data governed by intellectual property laws in these 3rd-party locations. Coaching (through staff-awareness trainings, refer to Chapter 3) on risks associated with storing confidential information will go a long way in acceptance of this policy. 
- If cloud storage is used for team collaboration, access should be limited to the appropriate individuals and all passwords should be stored in a password database manager such as KeePass. Passwords to cloud-based services should follow the password policy detailed in this chapter. Passwords to cloud-based data must be rotated upon any loss of device, breach of access, or suspected breach, and the changes updated in the password management database.
- Staff should be made aware of the risks (through staff-awareness trainings, refer to Chapter 3) associated with accessing cloud-based storage via public computers, on devices without an antivirus or pirated software and over a public, unsecured wifi connection.
- The IT staff departure policy should address revocation of access to data stored in online (cloud) repositories.

#### Data Log Retention ####

Analyzing data logs may provide deeper insights into data-related incidents and their correlation. Consider retaining firewall and application server logs for longer than 30-days, only after ensuring secure policies (encryption and physical access) are in place with respect to retention of logs. More logs usually mean more data to protect – as such, you may instead consider a log review process (minimum every 5-business days) that gets the benefit of analyzing logs, without putting too much data at risk. (Refer to Chapter 6 for additional best practices on Data Retention & Security).

#### Minimize data collection via your website ####

It's best to collect minimum personal identifiable information from site visitors. However, if your website does collect visitor information to encourage use of interactive features, then it’s imperative to take extra steps to inform users about how their information will be used and protected and communicate practices to safe-guard user data transparently via a privacy policy statement. Internal business processes of storing and sharing user data (such as choice of a web analytical tool or backup system) should reflect security protocols communicated via this publically-communicated privacy policy. Annual review of business processes with respect to handling of user data is encouraged. Ensure that your website is SSL enabled. Refer to Chapter 8 and 9 for additional security best practices.


#### Safeguard employee personal information ####

Collect only the minimum amount of personal information necessary to achieve your purposes. Create a data retention policy for employee data that is shared with all employees. A data retention policy should help your staff understand how their personal information is stored, distributed with the appropriate stakeholders and deleted. Employee data should be flagged as “sensitive” and encrypted during storage and when shared. In addition, be aware of your privacy requirements - understand local laws to ensure your internal policies match local laws on data privacy and retention.

#### Safeguards against publicly available information ####

Based on your organization’s Risk Assessment (Refer to Chapter 1), raise awareness about personal identifiable data of employees publicly available in public databases or on social networking sites. Train staff on protecting themselves against social engineering, which usually manipulates publicly available information about users to create targeted attacks. Ensure that your organization has a protocol in place with respect to exposure of staff and projects in online public forums and addresses the consequences of sharing sensitive information publicly.

#### Safeguards against data breaches ####

Ensure that protocols are put in place for protecting physical information received via delivery services like a courier service or via snail mail (such as, key documents should not left unattended in a post-box). Based on your organization’s Risk Assessment (Refer to Chapter 1), it’s recommended to familiarize yourself with data-security-breach notification local laws that might apply to your organization, and to build an incident response team. For planning against data breaches resulting from improper physical security (shredding and access), refer to Chapter 8. To protect against data breaches resulting from poor networking choices - refer to chapter 7 for best practices.
