To maintain a seamless system administration environment, it's best to formalize the process of responding to incidents and communicating this policy to staff and the tech team (especially, in the case when there is more than one system administrator). The goal of incident reporting is non-punitive and it is considered an essential best practice for trouble-shooting network conflicts.

An incident is a tech emergency which may include the following [^incident_policy]:

- Confiscation/theft of organization equipment
- Office raid or anticipated raid
- Malware or virus outbreak in the office; malware on website or server
- Network outage or loss of Internet connection in the office.
- Outages of production business systems (email, intranet, external-facing website).
- Confirmed instance of any targeted attack from a state actor or non-state action (hacker)

The incident response procedure [^incident_policy] for your organization should include the following components:

**Reporting**: Define a process for the affected audience to notify you of the incident. For example, if staff cannot access email during the weekend or do not have access to the Internet after business hours, what is the procedure for them to contact you. A simple case of forgotten password or password expiration should not be considered an emergency.

**Response, Escalation**: Once notification of an incident is received, where possible, take necessary steps to escalate the issue (for example: notify a vendor in case of hardware failure or ISP in case of internet outage) and organize your team (if more than one sysadmin) with specific roles and responsibilities.

**Communication**: Define a communication plan to report outage to staff & key stakeholders immediately with frequent updates shared, at least every 12 hours, until the issue is resolved.

**Documentation**: Ensure that a process to document any configuration changes, along with a detailed analysis of the outages and steps to prevent repeat incidents.
