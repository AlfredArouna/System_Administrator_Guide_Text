Across our digital assets (devices and online accounts), passwords are the modus operandi of gaining access to authorized content. They are our first line-of-defense in preventing unauthorized access to content and devices and as such, they deserve the required attention and thought-process beyond the careless, easy-to-remember, six-character ritual that most users adopt, viewing passwords as an hindrance to access.

A password policy is a set of rules which are created to improve computer security by preventing unauthorized access and by motivating users to create dependable, secure passwords; storing and utilizing them properly.

#### Set a standard ####

Acceptable passwords must be carefully chosen by the user and enforced by the system. Controls must be implemented to require strong passwords such as:

- Minimum length & complexity: Security experts have been recommending the use of passphrases versus a password that is at least eight (8) characters long, with a combination of alphanumeric characters. Passphrases which are usually a series of words, (for example: “oh no its Donald Trump for 2016 again!” provide the necessary complexity making it difficult to guess and/or brute force, while being easy to remember- a definite win-win from the end user’s perspective.
- Password Age: the password policy should enforce users to update their passwords every 90 days (3-months) at the very least. Encouraging users to change their passwords after travel is highly recommended (Refer to Traveller’s policy for further best practices).
- In addition to using passphrases, 2-factor authentication (where feasible to implement) should be enabled across all online services to provide added security.

Users should be reminded against:

- Creating passwords that contain personal identifiable information (PII) such as names, birthdates or addresses- such passwords are substantially easier to crack
- Sharing their passwords via phone, email, chat or verbally
- Visibly displaying passwords on post-it notes
- Using the same password across all their digital assets
- Not logging out of online accounts, especially when using public computers

#### User Account Mainenance ####

- Ensure that all user ids belong to currently authorized users; user ids that are inactive for 90 days must be disabled - be sure to add this task to your daily checklist
- Employee onboarding/exit rules: When system users are no longer part of an organization, or their duties change, their account access must be appropriately modified or terminated. Requests to change access privileges must be signed and forwarded to the appropriate designated individual by the responsible manager.
- Limit Log-on Attempts: Limit the number of log-on attempts to online accounts to five (5) - this helps to prevent guessing of authentication data.  Set communication policies in place to ensure users know how to contact you in case they are locked out from their accounts.

#### Password Recovery ####

- Put procedures in place to ensure passwords can be reset without your direct intervention. Refrain from using a password-reset system that emails users their passwords in clear text or provides “password hints” that can be easily guessed by a hacking attempt.
- Discourage users from using personal identifiable information (PII) when answering security questions such as “where were you born?” or “location of your first job” - usually, these questions can be easily obtained via information shared on social networking websites or simple research.
- Enforce password history: This will discourage users from recycling their old passwords.
- Accounts with stolen passwords should be disabled immediately. Systems should be monitored to ensure unauthorized access is prevented via stolen passwords or shared accounts.

#### Password Storage ####

- Institute a policy for the use of password managers (such as KeePass) to store passwords in irreversible encrypted form.
- Password managers make password management user and security-friendly, especially as end-users adopt best practices such as using a different password for each account.
- In addition, they also assure security, by protecting end-users against keyloggers (malware).

#### Password management for multi-lingual users ####

Most users, in most countries, have keyboards that include most Latin characters. This means that they are able to type passwords composed of "English" letters, even if they don't read or write the language.[^multilingual] When composing your organization’s password policy, it's important to consider the limitations on the password fields of systems and applications, as not every system or application supports non-Latin characters in the password field. In addition, remind users about password privacy best practices (i.e: the danger of someone looking over their shoulder) if text input involves a display component.

#### User Adoption ####

As with any security best practices, consider “user adoption” while enforcing password policies – the key is to find the right balance between security and privacy. A password manager (discussed discussed here) and user-awareness trainings (Refer to Chapter 3) can help gain the necessary buy-in and reduce end-user push-back towards safer password best practices.
