As access to technology and the Internet gets more affordable around the globe, organizational emails and data are being accessed by an increasing number of users on their personal devices (laptops and phones). Moreover, depending on the size of your organization or your staff’s work status (freelancers or consultants), staff’s personal devices may be the only alternative available for most individuals to perform work activities.

Consumer devices are designed to be managed by an individual, not en masse, and although these “endpoints” reside outside of the control of the IT department, it's imperative to consider the following guidelines to institute control over your organization’s data and subsequent risks to the network as staff use their personal devices for work purposes.

#### Get Stakeholder Buy-In ####

A policy will only succeed if it is designed in collaboration with key stakeholders. After all, these stakeholders are your end-users who, if not engaged, will pose a threat to the organization’s network and data via their bad security practices. As such, ensure that the BYOD policy has input from key users in the organization, such as, decision-makers and “road warriors” (staff who travel often), in collaboration with the human resources, legal departments and tech staff.

Use the Risk Assessment framework (Refer to Chapter 1) to guide the BYOD policy design process with respect to what data can be accessed via personal devices. All stakeholders should be on the same page about what data can be accessed and understand the risks associated due data loss if the personal device is lost, stolen, damaged or confiscated. Involving them in the policy design process will also ensure adoption to the policy.

The BYOD policy should be clearly communicated to participating staff and compliance should be made mandatory.

#### Access to Sensitive Data ####

With data segregated by sensitivity based on your organization’s Risk Assessment (Refer to Chapter 1), the BYOD policy should address how access to sensitive data will be addressed, especially with key decision-makers who usually have more access to secure information. Device monitoring, access control, strong password policies, 2-factor authentication are some strategies that may help you manage access to sensitive data via end-user devices.

#### Device Security Checklist ####

Before granting access to work emails and data to personal employee devices, create a device security checklist. At a high-level, the checklist should include the following:

- Ensure your users understand the risks associated with device loss, which could lead to loss of organizational data on their phone, especially true with downloads of sensitive attachments, contacts & email on their device.
- Enable 2-factor authentication on their work email account before access is enabled
- Encrypt their devices.
- Encourage use of a strong password and a password manager such as KeePass on their device (Refer to Chapter 6 for end-user privacy protection and encryption tools).
- Ensure they have anti-virus and licensed software on their devices; and their software is fully patched and updated. Remote wipe is enabled on devices.
- Set a communication protocol in place for staff to alert you when the device is lost, stolen, damaged or confiscated.
- Ensure that staff understand the risks of accessing work data over unsecured, public WAPs (wireless access points) and are using a VPN to browse the internet or check emails (Refer to Chapter 6 for end-user privacy protection and encryption tools).
- Create a data backup plan with staff to ensure their data is getting backed up securely and regularly.

#### Risks associated to mobile device location & recording capabilities ####

Mobile devices are inherently insecure and offer an array of technologies, ranging from Global Positioning System (GPS) receivers to cameras and audio recorders. The BYOD policy should cover the use of these features as they relate to work. It's not just data loss or user privacy that's a concern, but also, potential loss of intellectual property if recording or photos of a project are accidentally leaked, lost, stolen or confiscated.[^byod]

Develop device loss, theft and staff exit policies

Ensure that the BYOD policy addresses risks associated with device loss, theft and employee departure. Ensure that there is a way to revoke access of devices to network resources under these circumstances.

#### There’s an App for that?! ####

Since it will be difficult to control individual user devices, system administrators can raise awareness about risks associated with apps with respect to user privacy (collection of and access to data). It may be easier to focus on allowed app behaviors (for example: disabling collection of location data if its not required by the app to function), what type of data can be accessed by each app (for example: contacts, photos, location data) and precautionary measures to consider before downloading apps. Conducting regular trainings and raising staff awareness (Refer to Chapter 3) will go a long way in ensuring staff are aware of risks associated via insecure apps that could hamper data security and their privacy.

#### Formalize your 24x7 support ####

With access to work email and resources available on staff devices, create a clear communication policy for IT support available after hours and on weekends, and ensure that IT services are up and running 24x7 as downtime is no longer an option.

#### Prepare your network ####

Consumer devices are voice, video, high-def image and application rich. Employees using these devices will devour bandwidth and network resources. Assess your existing switch and router networks, your wired and wireless access in the office, the size of your Internet pipes and connections to remote locations. Make adjustments in advance of the increased demands that are inevitable on your IT network infrastructure grid.[^byod] Consider setting up separate wifi networks for guests versus employees that employees bringing in their devices can connect to as well, instead of their devices gaining access to all network resources and assets. (Refer to Chapter 7 for network segregation best practices).

#### Continuously Monitor Automated Actions ####

Understand the devices that are connecting to your network, as device manufacturers will sometimes upgrade their software without any notice. Device manufacturers, such as Apple and Samsung, are not a part of your organization’s change management process and you can expect new software updates to be dropped overnight creating connectivity, application and security issues.

#### Future Trend ####

With companies and organizations struggling with challenges associated with BYOD, new trends such as “Desktop as a Service” (DaaS) are emerging to solve the BYOD puzzle.[^future_trend] This promising trend aims to virtualize users’ desktops and deliver them as a service, giving them the ability to access a virtual desktop via different devices, from a physical desktop or laptop to a tablet or smartphone. This would eliminate the risks associated with loss of sensitive data due to device compromise and creates a segregated virtual work environment that would be easier for System Administrators to manage, however, any user privacy concerns as are yet to be determined.
