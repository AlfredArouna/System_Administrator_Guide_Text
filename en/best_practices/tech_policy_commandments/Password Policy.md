####Password Policy
Across our digital assets (devices and online accounts), passwords are the modus operandi of gaining access to authorized content. They are our first line-of-defense in preventing unauthorized access to content & devices and as such, they deserve the required attention & thought-process beyond the careless, easy-to-remember, 6 character ritual that most users adopt, viewing passwords as an hindrance to access. 

A password policy is a set of rules which are created to improve computer security by preventing unauthorized access and by motivating users to create dependable, secure passwords; storing and utilizing them properly.

**Set a standard**
Acceptable passwords must be carefully chosen by the user and enforced by the system. Controls must be implemented to require strong passwords such as:  
- Minimum length & complexity: Security experts have been recommending the use of passphrases versus a password that is at least eight (8) characters long, with a combination of alphanumeric characters. Passphrases which are usually a series of words, (for example: “oh no its Donald Trump for 2016 again!” provide the necessary complexity making it difficult to guess and/or brute force, while being easy to remember- a definite win-win from the end user’s perspective. 
- Password Age: the password policy should enforce users to update their passwords every 90 days (3-months) at the very least. Encouraging users to change their passwords after travel is highly recommended (Refer to Traveller’s policy for further best practices). 
- In addition to using passphrases, 2-factor authentication (where feasible to implement) should be enabled across all online services to provide added security. 

Users should be reminded against:  
●	Creating passwords that contain personal identifiable information (PII) such as names, birthdates or addresses- such passwords are substantially easier to crack. 
●	Sharing their passwords via phone, email, chat or verbally
●	Visibly displaying passwords on post-it notes
●	Using the same password across all their digital assets
●	Not logging out of online accounts, especially when using public computers
